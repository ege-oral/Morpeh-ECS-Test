## Pitch

Unity Morpeh ECS Test is a learning-focused demo project designed to explore and master Entity Component System (ECS) architecture using the Morpeh framework. This project serves as a hands-on laboratory for understanding ECS principles, performance optimization, and best practices in Unity game development.

## Users

**Primary User:** Solo developer focused on learning and mastering ECS patterns
- Personal skill development in modern Unity architecture
- Understanding performance-oriented game development
- Building reusable patterns and systems for future projects

## The Problem

Traditional Unity development often leads to monolithic MonoBehaviour-based architectures that become difficult to maintain, optimize, and scale. Understanding ECS patterns is crucial for modern game development, but learning resources often lack practical, hands-on implementation examples with real-world scenarios.

## Differentiators

- **Hands-on Learning Focus:** Built specifically for experimentation and learning rather than production
- **Morpeh Framework Integration:** Utilizes the lightweight and performant Morpeh ECS framework
- **Documented Learning Journey:** Every implementation decision and pattern is documented for future reference
- **Performance-First Approach:** Emphasizes optimization and best practices from the ground up

## Key Features

- **ECS Architecture Implementation:** Clean separation of data (Components), logic (Systems), and entities
- **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in systems for measuring and optimizing performance
- **Modular System Design:** Reusable systems that can be easily extended or modified
- **Enemy Spawning System:** Demonstrates entity lifecycle management and system interactions
- **Component Disposal Patterns:** Proper resource management and memory optimization
- **Refactored Codebase:** Continuously improved structure based on learning and best practices
